# Recipes Project

This is a project that requires me to make a website consisting of a main index page that has links to a few recipes. This project is going to be part of The Odin project (TOP) course I am taking. Once completed I will demonstrate my HTML skills, specifically how use links, images and basic HTML syntax.
