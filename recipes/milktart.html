    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 375 degrees. Coat an 8-inch
            square cake pan with butter or nonstick baking spray.</li>

        <li>In a small bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and baking soda.</li>

        <li> In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a medium bowl if using an electric handheld mixer,
            beat the sugar, milk, eggs and salt on medium speed until pourable and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the
            butter, jam and vinegar, and whisk on high speed until well combined, about 30 seconds.</li>

        <li>Add the flour mixture in thirds, mixing on medium speed between additions and scraping the bowl as needed.
            Whisk just until no streaks of flour remain and the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake until golden brown on top and a cake tester or skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 30
            minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until slightly warm, about 15 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            While the cake is cooling, make the glaze: In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, sugar, butter, salt and
            3 tablespoons water. Warm over medium-low heat, whisking gently, until the butter melts and the mixture is
            smooth, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm if needed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Use a toothpick to poke small holes throughout the cake. Slowly pour all of the glaze evenly over the
            surface. It will pool on top; give it a few minutes to allow it to soak completely into the cake. Cut into
            large or small pieces to serve warm. The pudding will keep in the refrigerator in an airtight container for
            up to 1 week. Reheat by microwaving until warm, 10 to 15 seconds.
        </li>
    </ol>
